					<p>Out of all the destinations I’ve been to, <b>Bora Bora</b> is the one trip I get asked about the most, and for good reason.
						Overwater bungalows sprawled across the pristine blue lagoon alongside some of the most vibrant coral reefs in the world make Bora Bora an attractive destination for honeymooners, couples, or those in search of rest and relaxation.
						Surely Bora Bora is one of the most beautiful places on earth, however planning a trip there can can be more elusive than other destinations.
						This Bora Bora travel blog answers all the frequently asked questions I get about Bora Bora. <u>I hope you find it helpful in planning your trip.</u></p>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.morefamousquotes.com/quotes/2497348-bora-bora-is-peaceful-and-quiet-but-fun.html">“Bora Bora is peaceful and quiet, but fun, so full of cool activities and more; spiritual to the core, and you leave with fully recharged batteries.” — Gilles Marini</blockquote>
					<p>Bora Bora (French: Bora-Bora; Tahitian: Pora Pora) is a 30.55 km2 (12 sq mi) island group in the Leeward group in the western part of the Society Islands of French Polynesia,
						an overseas collectivity of the French Republic in the Pacific Ocean. The main island, located about 230 kilometres (143 miles) northwest of Papeete, is surrounded by a lagoon and a barrier reef.
						In the center of the island are the remnants of an extinct volcano rising to two peaks, Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu, the highest point at 727 metres (2,385 feet). It is part of the commune of Bora-Bora, which also includes the atoll of Tūpai.</p>
